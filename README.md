## Inspiration
Sales teams often face challenges when trying to connect with the right customers for the right products. The vast amount of data available about customer preferences, purchase history, and product interest can be overwhelming to sift through manually. Inspired by the potential to make sales campaigns more effective, ‚ÄúCapital Match‚Äù was designed to leverage customer profile data and product details to create hyper-personalized product recommendations. This solution empowers sales teams to engage their target audience with precision, boosting customer satisfaction, increasing conversion rates, and optimizing overall marketing efforts through targeted outreach.

## What it does
Capital Match is a smart recommendation service that analyzes customer profiles, including transaction patterns and preferences, alongside product data to generate personalized recommendations. It helps sales teams identify valuable prospects and automatically drafts tailored emails summarizing recommended products and their benefits. This boosts communication efficiency and increases conversion potential through thoughtful, personalized messaging.

## How we built it
Capital Match leverages **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** with a vector database and the Llama3 API. We transformed customer profiles into embeddings using **BAAI‚Äôs bge-small-en embedding model** and stored them in a vector database. When queried, it identifies customer behavior patterns and maps them to relevant product recommendations. Using this data, hyper-personalized emails are generated with Llama3.

We utilized **LangChain** to streamline the process of prompting and creating sequential chains, enhancing the flow and interaction between various AI models. The system features a **Streamlit dashboard** for a user-friendly interface, while **FastAPI** manages data requests and communications, ensuring smooth and efficient operations. This approach delivers precise, impactful customer targeting for sales teams.

## Challenges we ran into
It was difficult to find open-source customer profile data that accurately represents real-world user behavior patterns. To overcome this, we created our own synthetic data that closely mimics real-world user behaviors and interactions, enhancing the model's training and performance.
